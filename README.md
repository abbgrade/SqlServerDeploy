# SqlServerDeploy
Powershell Module that helps to deploy SQL Server projects

## Idea

The idea is to deploy SQL Server projects as easy as possible using Powershell Commands.
For example deploy Databases as DACPACs, Integration Services projects as ISPACs, Reports with Subscriptions, and Analysis Services Cubes only with a path to the artefact, the server instance and arguments like environment specific connection strings.
